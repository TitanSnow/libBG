# For issues

* Any kind of issues is welcome including questions.
* If you wanna report a bug, please help me to recreate. (means to be as verbose as possible)
* Problems about Windows and MacOS may have delay to fix because I don't have them.
* xmake is a new buildtool. If you have trouble building with it, please report to xmake.
* I have right to close your issue after fixing problems but I want you to close it by yourself because it will be easier to reopen it in the future.
* Before reporting a bug, checkout lastest master to check if it has already fixed.

# For pulls

* *First open an issue pointing to your branch to let me check if it is needed to open a PR.*
* First line *must be a brief look* to show why you open it or what features added.
* Passing the CIs is important. Because appveyor is slow and usually run for over an hour, please be patient.
* 4 spaces, no tabs.
* <code>myfunc(vector&lt;int&gt; const &nums)</code> is better than <code>myfunc(vector&lt;int&gt; nums)</code> if possible.
* Const member function if it doesn't modify object.

# For both

* Always use English.
